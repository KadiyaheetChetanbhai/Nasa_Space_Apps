                <div class="Rocketdata2">Rocket propulsion engines are the heart of any spacecraft, propelling them
                    through the vacuum of space by expelling mass at high speeds in the opposite direction, following
                    Newton's third law of motion: for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Here's a
                    brief explanation of how rocket propulsion engines work</div>

                shortest
                route is not always the most efficient. Advanced navigation systems are used to find the most
                efficient
                routes for spacecraft to travel.Another was “wormholes” — bridges connecting different points in spacetime, in theory providing shortcuts for space travellers.</div>
